		<h2>Things I like to do</h2>
		<p> In my free time, you could find me working in the pharmacy, crocheting, or hanging out with my family.
			I've been working in the pharmacy for almost six months and I love it, everyday you learn and experience something new.
			I taught myself how to crochet over quarantine and I've been doing it ever since. I've made quite a few stuffed animals,
			dog bandannas, and a lot of other random little projects.</p>
